Brain baby.exe

	-brains spawn more brains

	-completes levels to get brain juice to MAKE MORE BRAINs
	
	-8bit theme (art, music, etc.)

	levels:
	
		flat platform, brain juice falling from the skies, zombies coming from either side,
		
		trying to catch the brain juice,

		with each drop, brain gets bigger,
		
		zombie bite reduces brain size by one,

		win when brain is whole screen?

		lose when zombies eat all of your brain

		in early levels:

				no zombies, just trying to grow brain, plant sapling
		
		in middle levels:

				bring out the zombies

		in later levels:

				introduce brain poison (social commentary?) -> brain poison

				falls from sky, now you have to avoid poison. poison poisons you

				and paralyzes you so zombies can EAT YOUR BRAINS.

		in final levels:

				brain is slow, grows less, gray, unwinnable last level, some sort of final sequence,
				tree is fully grown


	music:

		starts peaceful at early levels, slowly gets more full, darker

	art:
		brain starts out pink and lively, ends old and gray
		
		zombies should be gray

		
	~social commentary~

		brain represents you:
				
				starts out youthful, just trying to grow brain(learn),
				later in life zombies start attacking you to inhibit growth(like people
				trying to keep you down), later in life brain starts to get poisoned
				(your knowledge starts getting poisoned), at end of game, brain is slow
				and old.
